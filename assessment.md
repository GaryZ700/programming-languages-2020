## Assessment

The practical component will be assessed by 

- 5% of the course: Participation in lectures and office hours as well as asking, discussing, and answering questions on the [discussion forum](discussion-forum.md).

  One good way to get participation going is to to **ask at least one question for every lecture**. Here are some reasons why I think that this is a good idea:

  - I often feel uncomfortable when asking questions. But asking good questions is one of the most important skills. It is good to use every opportunity to practice.
  - Thinking about questions is the best way to start revising the material.
  - Most importantly, every question you ask is feedback that allows me to make the course more relevant to you.

- 45% of the course: 
  - 3 [assignments](assignments.md), worth 9% each
  - a [blog/tutorial](blog.md) on Haskell for beginners published on the web, worth 18%

The theoretical component will be assessed by a final exam worth 30% and a number of tests during the semester worth together 20%. 

- 50% of the course on theoretical aspects.  
  - 2 tests (midterms) worth 10% each (one on termrewriting and one on program verification).
  - Final exam worth 30%. The final exam will cover the same material as the two midterms which will also serve as a study guide. 

**Homework:** Most lectures will finish with some homework. Homework is not graded but feel free to hand it in for feedback or come into my office hourse to discuss. Homework is essential to achieve the learning outcomes.
